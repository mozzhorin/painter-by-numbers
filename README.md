# Deep Learning on Kubeflow
## Semester project @ Big Data Technologies (SS 2019) 
Goethe University Frankfurt am Main |
Autors: Iurii Mozzhorin & Rebekka Pech |
Tutors: Todor Ivanov & Timo Eichhorn

The goal of this project was to explore how useful can Kubeflow be for solving tasks of deep learning. 
As an example problem, we have trained the ResNet-50 model to distinguish between works of ten painters 
from "Painter-by-numbers" dataset from kaggle.com.
